Skeleton code and sanity specs for homework 2, fall 2015

Skeleton Code
=============

The skeleton code files for parts 1-5 are located in the lib/` directory .

Running Sanity Specs
====================
To run the rspec sanity checks for part 1 type the following command while
in the parent directory of the `lib and `spec directories:

    `rspec spec/part1_spec.rb`

The output should look something like:

    ...

    Finished in 0.00206 seconds
    3 examples, 0 failures

The commands for parts 2-5 are similar.

    NOTE: Passing the sanity check does not, in any way, insure that your code is
    correct.  The sanity check simply insures that your code conforms to the basic
    specificaton necessary to be tested by our automated testing tools.
